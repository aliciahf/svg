# DRAWING ON THE WEB: SVG PROJECT
Spring 2016 
(Version Control Assignment)

----------

## FORKED REPO (original by Zach Lee)
Modified original project which featured two origami birds dipping down onto a tree. Took the red bird and made it "fly" by adding more CSS transitions (specifically rotate and transform).
